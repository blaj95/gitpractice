### Clone the repository

      * git clone https://github.com/pisontechnology/gitpractice.git
   
### Get Status/ Pull
   * we do not need to do this right now, because we just cloned. Normally, this would be your first step in your routine/ flow. This should always been done prior to working to get the most recent updates from the server. Failure to do this will likely result in your machine getting "ahead" of the server, and an increase in merge conflicts.
   * **git status**
   * **git pull** 
   
### Make some changes to it (add your name) and save.

### Add the changed file to the index   
   * **git add "filename" or** 
      * git add README.md
   * **git add . (for all files)**
   
### Commit the files to the index to be synced with the remote server
* **git push** 
   * allows you to add a longer message
* **git push -m "message"**
   * git push -m "7.13.2017 / mk / added my name to the readme task"
